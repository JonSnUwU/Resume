Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):

Description: Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, compromising their data or executing unintended actions.
Types: Stored XSS, Reflected XSS, DOM-based XSS.

SQL Injection (SQLi):

Description: Attackers inject SQL queries through input fields to manipulate or retrieve data from the database, potentially leading to data leaks or unauthorized access.
Prevention: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):

Description: Exploits the trust a web application has in a user's browser by executing unwanted actions on behalf of the user.
Prevention: Use anti-CSRF tokens to validate requests.

Insecure Deserialization:

Description: Malicious manipulation of serialized objects, leading to remote code execution, security bypass, or data tampering.
Prevention: Validate and sanitize serialized data.

Sensitive Data Exposure:

Description: Failure to protect sensitive data (like passwords, credit card details) properly, leading to potential theft or exposure.
Prevention: Encrypt sensitive data, use secure transmission protocols (HTTPS), and avoid storing unnecessary sensitive information.

Security Misconfigurations:

Description: Improperly configured servers, frameworks, or applications that can expose sensitive information or vulnerabilities.
Prevention: Regularly update software, apply least privilege principles, and follow security best practices.

Broken Authentication:

Description: Weaknesses in authentication mechanisms, such as poor password policies, session management flaws, or exposed credentials.
Prevention: Implement strong password policies, multi-factor authentication, and secure session handling.

XML External Entity (XXE):

Description: Exploits vulnerable XML processors, allowing attackers to read sensitive files, execute remote requests, or perform denial-of-service attacks.
Prevention: Disable XML external entity parsing or use safe parsers.

Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards:

Description: Attackers manipulate unvalidated input to redirect users to malicious websites or phishing pages.
Prevention: Avoid using user-controlled input for redirection; validate and sanitize input.

Security Headers Misconfiguration:

Description: Improperly configured security headers or missing security-related HTTP headers that expose the application to various attacks.
Prevention: Set appropriate security headers to enhance web application security.
